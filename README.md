# Prediction mean values and exceeding limit days of fine Particulate Matter in the air of Milan
The research mainly aims to identify through classification algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) if one day,
based on its climatic features and concentrations of harmful elements in the air, it turns out to be harmful (or not) to the health of
citizens in the Milan metropolis. Furthermore, a second prediction model, Linear Regression, was adopted to predict daily mean PM2.5 values.
